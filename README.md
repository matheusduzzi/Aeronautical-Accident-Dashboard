# Aeronautical-Accident-Dashboard
A simple dashboard using streamlit to demonstrate knowledge in creating data visualizations in python interactively.

The idea of this dashboard is to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the classes of the "Data Science School" course.

In this project, the objective is to translate public data on aviation accidents so that users can have an overview of the subject without having to explore the database.
